This course spans the continent of Africa, but also investigates black diaspora settlements around the world, to redefine our Western understanding of ritual  and performance . Here, we will discover that 'ritual' is not always cosmic or spiritual, but sometimes involves the intimate activity of body decoration, or hairstyling; that 'performances' are a daily, central aspect of most black communities-that distinctly theatric elements of social performance are not only a part of masquerades, but also seen in traditional wrestling matches (and body design), ritual seclusion and fattening, and religious (or funerary) processions. This course is especially invested in addressing prevalent themes of performance in the African Diaspora (especially in the African-American culture), and understanding the many connections between diaspora performance and theatre to the visual arts of Africa.",

Topics that will be studies in detail in this course include: the political ecology of conservation and indigenous peoples; the political ecology of food, agriculture and rural development; the political ecology of urbanization and suburbanization.",
