Our study reaches into the murky history of black representation during the period of 'European Enlightenment,' but also engages the intersections of the biological and social sciences with anthropological studies during the colonial era, which left the African continent divided up as property of various European entities, but also placed the black body in an uncomfortable state of 'investigation'-a state that winds up defining the survivors of the Atlantic Slave Trade into the American cultural space.   From the famous 'scientific' slave daguerreotypes of Harvard's own Louis Agassiz, to children's literature depicting black kids being devoured by large animals, to the horrific recordings of torture, mutilations, and slayings of black people into postcards for the marketplace, with the assistance of the students, this course seeks to arrive at a set of unique and useful questions about Europe's and America's historic visual history and representations of the black body.",

The laboratory portion of the course provides a �hands-on� introduction to the practical aspects of physical geology, including the identification of minerals and rocks, the interpretation of topographic and geologic maps, and the development of landforms. The course includes several field trips that involve additional time commitments (on weekends or beyond the normal ending time for the laboratory).

Conservation laws, energy, momentum, collisions, and rotational motion are also considered. Material is explored using a student-centered, inquiry approach melding laboratory and more traditional approaches. Three longer activities emphasizing experimental design and data collection are undertaken across the semester in addition to the daily explorations. Mathematical prerequisites are high school algebra and trigonometry. The concepts of slope and area under the curve are used throughout the course, but formal calculus is not required.

Additionally, we will present selected theoretical frameworks or �analytical models� that have been developed � some of which have actually fanned the flames of racism more than subdued it � to help provide students with a kid of graphic understanding of racial phenomena. Lastly, the terminal course objective will be synthesis of class learning and your own invaluable personal perspective in the form of a final paper or project based on your research and evaluation of a particular U.S. institution.",
